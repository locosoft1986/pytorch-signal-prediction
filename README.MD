### Pytorch Seq2Seq Signal Prediction Exercises
Inspired by Tensorflow version: https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction/blob/master/seq2seq.py

[x] Exercise 1: Predict the future signals of dataset V1 using seq2seq model. The dataset generator V1 should randomly produce a two features data set of sine and cosin signals.
