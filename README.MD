### Pytorch Seq2Seq Signal Prediction Exercises
Inspired by Tensorflow version: https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction/

[x] Exercise 1: Predict the future signals of dataset V1 using seq2seq model. The dataset generator V1 should randomly produce a two features data set of sine and cosin signals.

[-] Exercise 2: Predict the future signals of dataset V2 using seq2seq model. The dataset shoudl randomly produce a superposition of two sine waves.(In Progress: currently using bidirectional LSTM)
